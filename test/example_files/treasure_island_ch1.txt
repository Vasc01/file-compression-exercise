Treasure Island
Robert Louis Stevenson , 1883

1. The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow

SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these
gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole
particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to
the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet
lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 and go back
to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn
and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up
his lodging under our roof.
